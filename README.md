There is 4 projects about digital image processing.

Image_changing - Logarithmic image correction and low-pass filter.  
Clustering - Clustering image with help of logatithmic correction based on some signs.  
Hopfield_NeuralNetwork - Network that is trained on 10x10 images. It\'s ability is to restore images if it possible.  
Multilayer_Perceptron - Network that is trained on five 8x8 images. It\'s ability is to predict one of basic images by test image.

Some images wich was used to test this projects are in the "Images" foldier.
